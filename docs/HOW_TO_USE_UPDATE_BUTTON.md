# 🔄 How to Use the "Update All Clients" Button

## Overview
The **"Update All Clients"** button in the dashboard provides a one-click solution to deploy the latest client files to all connected UE5 projects. This ensures your UE5 clients always have the most recent code, including bug fixes and new features.

## Location
The button is located in the **dashboard header**, right next to the project status indicator:
```
[Active Project Dropdown] [Status: Not connected] [🔄 Update All Clients]
```

## How It Works

### 1. **One-Click Update Flow**
```
1. Click "🔄 Update All Clients" button
   ↓
2. Dashboard sends WebSocket "auto_update" message to all connected UE5 clients
   ↓
3. Each UE5 client downloads fresh files from POST /api/download_client_bundle
   ↓
4. Files are extracted to Content/Python/AIAssistant/
   ↓
5. UE5 client auto-reloads with latest code
   ↓
6. Success notification shows how many clients were updated
```

### 2. **CDN Bypass Architecture**
- ✅ Uses **POST endpoint** to bypass Replit's immutable CDN
- ✅ Always downloads **fresh files**, never cached versions
- ✅ Includes all diagnostic tools (diagnose.py, install_dependencies.py)

### 3. **Real-Time Feedback**
The button provides visual feedback:
- **⏳ Updating...** - Update in progress
- **✅ Updated!** - Success (shows count of updated clients)
- **❌ Failed** - Error occurred

## Prerequisites

### For the Update to Work:
1. ✅ UE5 is running
2. ✅ You've opened the Python console: `Tools → Plugins → Python Console`
3. ✅ You've executed: `import AIAssistant.main`
4. ✅ The dashboard shows "✅ Connected" status
5. ✅ WebSocket connection is active (green status in dashboard)

### If No Clients Connected:
The button will show an alert:
```
❌ No UE5 clients connected!

Make sure UE5 is running and you've executed:
import AIAssistant.main
```

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Connect Your UE5 Project
```python
# In UE5 Python Console:
import AIAssistant.main
```
- Wait for "✅ WebSocket connected" message
- Dashboard status changes to green

### Step 2: Click the Update Button
1. Go to the dashboard: `https://ue5-assistant-noahbutcher97.replit.app/dashboard`
2. Verify connection status is green
3. Click **"🔄 Update All Clients"** button
4. Wait for confirmation alert

### Step 3: Verify Update
You'll see a success message:
```
✅ Successfully updated 1 client(s)!

Files deployed with latest diagnostic tools:
- diagnose.py
- install_dependencies.py

The clients will automatically reload.
```

## What Gets Updated

### Files Included in Update:
- ✅ `AIAssistant/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- ✅ `AIAssistant/main.py` - Main client logic
- ✅ `AIAssistant/auto_update.py` - Auto-update system
- ✅ `AIAssistant/websocket_client.py` - Real-time communication
- ✅ `AIAssistant/config.py` - Configuration management
- ✅ `AIAssistant/diagnose.py` - **Diagnostic tool** (NEW!)
- ✅ `AIAssistant/install_dependencies.py` - **Dependency installer** (NEW!)
- ✅ All other client modules

### Auto-Generated Files:
- ✅ `auto_start.py` - Automatic initialization on UE5 startup

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No UE5 clients connected"
**Solution:**
1. Open UE5 Python Console
2. Run: `import AIAssistant.main`
3. Wait for WebSocket connection
4. Try update button again

### Issue: Update button shows "❌ Failed"
**Solution:**
1. Check UE5 console for errors
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try manual update: `import AIAssistant.auto_update; AIAssistant.auto_update.check_and_update()`

### Issue: Button disabled or grayed out
**Solution:**
1. Check WebSocket connection (should be green)
2. Refresh the dashboard page
3. Reconnect UE5 client

## Testing

### Run Automated Tests:
```bash
python test_auto_update.py
```

### Expected Results:
```
======================================================================
🚀 AUTO-UPDATE SYSTEM TEST SUITE

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Message Format:
```json
{
  "type": "auto_update",
  "project_id": "UE5_Assistant_5_6"
}
```

### Download Endpoint:
- **URL**: `POST /api/download_client_bundle`
- **Method**: POST (bypasses CDN)
- **Response**: ZIP file with all client files
- **Headers**: Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

### Update Process:
1. WebSocket client receives "auto_update" message
2. Calls `auto_update.check_and_update()`
3. Downloads ZIP from POST endpoint
4. Extracts to `Content/Python/AIAssistant/`
5. Reloads AIAssistant.main module
6. Returns success/failure status

## Security Features

### Safety Checks:
- ✅ Only works in UE5 environment (won't run on backend)
- ✅ Validates ZIP file integrity before extraction
- ✅ Creates backup of existing files
- ✅ Graceful error handling with detailed logging

### CDN Protection:
- ✅ POST endpoint never cached
- ✅ Always serves latest code
- ✅ Immune to Replit CDN caching issues

## Benefits

### For You:
- ✅ One-click deployment to all clients
- ✅ No manual file copying
- ✅ No UE5 restart required
- ✅ Instant code distribution

### For Your Users:
- ✅ Always have latest features
- ✅ Automatic bug fixes
- ✅ Seamless updates
- ✅ No technical knowledge required

## Summary

The "🔄 Update All Clients" button provides a **production-grade, CDN-proof update system** that ensures all your UE5 clients stay synchronized with the latest code. Simply click the button, and all connected projects receive fresh files automatically!

🎯 **Key Takeaway**: This solves the Replit CDN caching problem by using WebSocket communication + POST endpoints to guarantee fresh file delivery every time.
