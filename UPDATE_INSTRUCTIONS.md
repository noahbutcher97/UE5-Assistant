# ðŸ”§ UPDATE YOUR UE5 CLIENT - FIX CONNECTION BUG

## The Problem
Your UE5 client is running old code that loses the HTTP client reference after module reloads. We fixed this, but you need to update your local client files.

## Quick Update (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Download Latest Client Code
1. Go to: https://replit.com/@noahbutcher97/UE5-Assistant
2. Download the entire `ue5_client` folder from Replit
3. Or use this direct link to download ZIP: (use the Replit download feature)

### Step 2: Replace Local Files
1. **Close Unreal Editor** (important!)
2. Navigate to: `D:/UnrealProjects/5.6/UE5_Assistant/Content/Python/`
3. **Backup your current AIAssistant folder** (rename it to `AIAssistant_backup`)
4. Copy the NEW `AIAssistant` folder from the downloaded `ue5_client` directory
5. Paste it into `D:/UnrealProjects/5.6/UE5_Assistant/Content/Python/`

### Step 3: Restart UE5
1. Launch Unreal Editor
2. The new code will auto-initialize
3. Look for these NEW log messages (confirms you have the fix):
   ```
   [HTTP] About to check result and return...
   [HTTP] self.http_client = <HTTPPollingClient object>
   [AIAssistant] ðŸ’¾ Preserving clients: HTTP=True, WS=False
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Connection
After UE5 restarts, run this in the Output Log Python console:
```python
import AIAssistant.main
assistant = AIAssistant.main.get_assistant()
print(f"âœ… HTTP Client: {assistant.http_client}")
print(f"âœ… Connected: {assistant.http_client.connected if assistant.http_client else 'Not connected'}")
```

**Expected output:**
```
âœ… HTTP Client: <HTTPPollingClient object at 0x...>
âœ… Connected: True
```

## Alternative: Manual File Copy

If you prefer to update files manually:

### Files That Changed (copy from Replit to local):
1. `ue5_client/AIAssistant/main.py` - Added persistent client globals
2. `ue5_client/AIAssistant/http_polling_client.py` - Added preservation calls
3. `ue5_client/AIAssistant/auto_update.py` - Added preservation before module clear

### Key Changes to Look For:
In `main.py` (around line 620):
```python
# Persistent client references that survive module reloads
_persistent_http_client = None
_persistent_ws_client = None
```

In `http_polling_client.py` (around line 295):
```python
# CRITICAL: Preserve client references BEFORE clearing modules
if 'AIAssistant.main' in sys.modules:
    main_module = sys.modules['AIAssistant.main']
    if hasattr(main_module, '_preserve_clients'):
        main_module._preserve_clients()
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Still Shows "Not Connected":
1. Make sure you closed UE5 before updating files
2. Verify the new files are in place (check for new log messages)
3. Try: `import AIAssistant.troubleshooter as ts; ts.reconnect()`

### If You See Old Log Messages:
Your files weren't updated correctly. Re-copy the files with UE5 closed.

### If Connection Still Fails:
1. Check the UE5 Output Log for the new debug messages
2. Run the verification command above
3. Share the latest UE5 logs

**What This Fix Does:**
- âœ… Preserves HTTP client across module reloads
- âœ… Prevents "NOT CONNECTED" status after successful connection
- âœ… Maintains dashboard real-time features
- âœ… Seamless code updates without losing connection

Once updated, your connection will persist reliably! ðŸŽ‰
