# Context-Aware AI Response System - Version 3.2

## 🎯 What Changed

### **PROBLEM SOLVED:**
Previously, when you asked questions like "what is my project name?", the system returned a canned data dump instead of a natural AI-interpreted answer. The AI was bypassed entirely.

### **NEW SOLUTION:**
Implemented a **two-phase context-aware flow** that:
1. Detects when user asks about UE5-specific data (project info, blueprints, files)
2. Collects the relevant context from UE5
3. Sends both the question AND context to AI for interpretation
4. Returns a natural language answer that addresses the specific question

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Example Flow: "What is my project name?"

**Old Behavior:**
```
User: "What is my project name?"
→ Backend returns: [UE_REQUEST] get_project_info
→ UE5 executes action
→ Returns: "PROJECT: UE5_Assistant\nMODULES: 47\nASSETS: 1234..."
❌ Generic data dump, not an answer
```

**New Behavior:**
```
User: "What is my project name?"
→ Backend returns: [UE_CONTEXT_REQUEST] project_info|What is my project name?
→ UE5 collects project metadata
→ Sends to /answer_with_context with question + context
→ AI analyzes and responds: "Your project is called UE5_Assistant."
✅ Natural, specific answer
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### New Backend Endpoint
**`POST /answer_with_context`**
- Receives user question + collected context data
- Sends to OpenAI with context-aware prompt
- Returns natural language answer

### New Token Type
**`[UE_CONTEXT_REQUEST] {context_type}|{original_question}`**
- Signals UE5 client to collect context and send for AI processing
- Supported context types:
  - `project_info` - Project metadata, modules, assets
  - `blueprint_capture` - Blueprint screenshot with vision analysis
  - `browse_files` - Project file tree

### Updated UE5 Client
**`attached_assets/AIAssistant/main.py`**
- New method: `_process_context_request()`
- Handles context collection for different types
- Calls backend `/answer_with_context` endpoint
- Works in both sync and async modes

## 📋 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Download Updated Files
Download the entire `attached_assets/AIAssistant/` folder from Replit

### 2. Deploy to UE5
```
Source:      attached_assets/AIAssistant/
Destination: D:\UnrealProjects\5.6\UE5_Assistant\Content\Python\AIAssistant
```

### 3. Clean Cache
**IMPORTANT:** Delete the `__pycache__` folder inside AIAssistant directory:
```
D:\UnrealProjects\5.6\UE5_Assistant\Content\Python\AIAssistant\__pycache\
```

### 4. Restart Unreal Editor
Close and reopen UE5 to reload the Python modules

## ✅ Testing the New System

### Test Questions (Natural Language Answers Expected)

**Project Information:**
- "What is my project name?"
- "Tell me about this project"
- "Give me a breakdown of my project"

**Blueprint Capture:**
- "Capture a screenshot of this blueprint"
- "Show me a picture of the blueprint graph"

**File Browsing:**
- "Show me files in my project"
- "List the files in Content folder"

### Expected Behavior
- **Before:** Canned data dumps
- **After:** Natural, conversational AI responses that answer the specific question

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend (Automatic)
The system automatically:
- Detects context-aware queries using keyword matching
- Routes to appropriate context collection
- Sends to AI for interpretation

### Feature Flags (config.json)
Ensure these are enabled:
```json
{
  "enable_file_operations": true,
  "enable_guidance_requests": true,
  "enable_blueprint_capture": true
}
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Data Dumps
**Solution:** 
1. Verify `__pycache__` is deleted
2. Restart UE5 editor completely
3. Check that backend is running (check Replit status)

### Issue: "Unknown context type" Error
**Cause:** Client/server version mismatch
**Solution:** Redeploy entire AIAssistant folder, ensure backend is latest

### Issue: No Response
**Check:**
1. Backend server is running: `https://ue5-assistant-noahbutcher97.replit.app`
2. UE5 Output Log for connection errors
3. OpenAI API key is set in Replit secrets

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **Natural Responses** - AI answers specific questions, not data dumps
✅ **Context-Aware** - Uses real UE5 project data for accurate answers
✅ **Flexible** - Works with project info, blueprints, files, and more
✅ **Backwards Compatible** - Old direct actions still work (describe_viewport, etc.)

## 📝 Files Modified

### Backend (Replit)
- `app/routes.py` - Added context-aware detection, new endpoint
- `app/models.py` - No changes needed

### UE5 Client (Deploy to UE5)
- `attached_assets/AIAssistant/main.py` - Added context request handling
- Other files unchanged

## 🚀 Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Test with project-specific questions
2. Verify natural language responses
3. Try blueprint capture with context-aware questions
4. Browse files with specific queries
