DEPRECATED FILES - DO NOT USE
================================

The following files were part of an abandoned Editor Utility Widget approach
that required Blueprint assets and did not work correctly:

- connection_troubleshooter.py
- launch_troubleshooter.py

These files are kept for reference only but should NOT be used.

USE INSTEAD:
- troubleshooter.py (simple console-based tools that actually work)

See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for current usage instructions.
