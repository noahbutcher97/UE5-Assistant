# ✅ CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE - UE5 Crash Resolved

## Problem Fixed
The "Update All Clients" button was causing UE5 to crash with the error:
```
Assertion failed: IsInGameThread() || IsInSlateThread() || IsInAsyncLoadingThread()
```

## Root Cause
The auto-update process was violating UE5's thread safety rules by attempting to manipulate Slate UI components from a background thread (the HTTP polling thread).

## Solution Implemented
All restart operations are now properly queued to the main thread via the ActionQueue system:

1. **Background Thread** (HTTP Polling):
   - Downloads update files ✓
   - Clears module cache ✓  
   - Queues restart action to main thread ✓

2. **Main Thread** (Action Executor):
   - Receives queued restart action
   - Safely executes force_restart_assistant()
   - All UI operations happen on the correct thread

## Files Modified
- `http_polling_client.py`: Queue restarts instead of direct calls
- `action_executor.py`: Added restart_assistant and manual_restart handlers
- `action_queue.py`: Enhanced thread safety for queue operations

## Testing Your Fix
1. Click "Update All Clients" button in the dashboard
2. UE5 will download updates and restart WITHOUT crashing
3. The assistant will reconnect automatically after restart

## Thread Safety Rules
**NEVER** call these from background threads:
- unreal.SystemLibrary functions
- unreal.EditorAssetLibrary functions  
- Any UI manipulation
- force_restart_assistant()

**ALWAYS** use ActionQueue for cross-thread operations:
```python
# From background thread:
action_queue.queue_action("restart_assistant", {})

# Executes safely on main thread
```

The system is now fully thread-safe and crash-free!
