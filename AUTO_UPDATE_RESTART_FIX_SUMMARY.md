# Auto-Update Restart Errors Fixed

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. `name 'time' is not defined` Error in action_queue.py

**Problem:** When modules are cleared during auto-update, the global `time` module import was lost, causing `time.time()` calls to fail with `NameError`.

**Solution:** Added local imports of the `time` module in all methods that use it:
- `queue_action()` - Added `import time as time_module` locally
- `process_queue()` - Added `import time as time_module` locally
- `tick_callback()` - Already had local import (was correct)

**Files Modified:**
- `ue5_client/AIAssistant/action_queue.py`

### 2. `name 'force_restart_assistant' is not defined` Error in http_polling_client.py

**Problem:** The `force_restart_assistant` function from the `auto_update` module was not being imported correctly after module clearing.

**Solution:** 
- Added proper module import with `import AIAssistant.auto_update as auto_update`
- Added `importlib.invalidate_caches()` to ensure fresh import
- Added `hasattr()` check before calling the function
- Implemented fallback `_manual_restart_assistant()` method if function is not available

**Files Modified:**
- `ue5_client/AIAssistant/http_polling_client.py`

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script `test_auto_update_restart.py` that verifies:
1. ✅ Time imports work correctly after module clearing
2. ✅ `force_restart_assistant` function can be imported and called
3. ✅ HTTPPollingClient emergency recovery mechanism works

All tests pass successfully!

## How the Auto-Update Process Now Works

1. **Update Triggered**: Dashboard clicks "Update All Clients"
2. **Files Downloaded**: Latest code downloaded from Replit backend
3. **Module Clearing**: Old cached modules are cleared from Python
4. **Safe Restart**: 
   - Time imports are now local, avoiding NameError
   - force_restart_assistant is properly imported with fallback
5. **Fresh Code Loaded**: New modules are imported with updated code
6. **Assistant Restarts**: Fresh instance created with new functionality

## Key Improvements

1. **Thread-Safe Execution**: All time-dependent operations now use local imports
2. **Robust Recovery**: Emergency recovery has fallback mechanisms
3. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery paths
4. **Module Management**: Proper cache invalidation and module clearing

## Result

The auto-update process now completes successfully without errors. When "Update All Clients" is clicked:
- Files download correctly ✅
- Modules clear properly ✅
- Restart happens smoothly ✅
- Fresh code is loaded ✅
- No more `NameError` exceptions ✅
