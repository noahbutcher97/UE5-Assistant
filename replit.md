# Unreal Engine AI Viewport Assistant

## Overview
This project delivers a FastAPI-based backend service designed to generate AI-powered technical documentation for Unreal Engine 5 editor viewport contexts. It processes structured viewport data from Unreal Engine's Python environment to create accurate, factual descriptions of 3D scenes and level designs using OpenAI's GPT models. The primary goal is to enhance UE5 developers' workflows by providing advanced insights and implementation guidance. Key features include multi-project management, context-aware AI responses, UE 5.6 compliant utility generation, comprehensive editor orchestration (scene building, camera control, actor manipulation), and a unified control dashboard. The project aims to bridge Unreal Engine's scripting capabilities with cloud-based AI, thereby boosting developer productivity and fostering innovative game development.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a **Unified Control Center** (`/dashboard`) with a Project Hub, Live Feed, Project Intelligence, Guidance, Tools, Settings, Diagnostics, and About sections. It employs a **Modern Design System** characterized by the Inter font, a refined spacing system (max-width 1400px dashboard container), professional aesthetics, subtle animations, and softer shadows. The **Tools Tab** provides AI-powered widget generation with automated class name sanitization. Key UI/UX elements include a browser-based **Project Selector** with real-time connection status, enhanced visuals (glowing text, micro-interactions), and quality-of-life features such as keyboard shortcuts, tooltips, one-click copy buttons, and visual feedback. The architecture is **Responsive**, offering mobile-friendly layouts and touch-optimized controls.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with **FastAPI** for async capabilities and Pydantic-based validation. **AI Integration** leverages OpenAI GPT models (default: gpt-4o-mini) for technical prose generation and multi-modal vision analysis. It includes a **Multi-Project Registry** for managing UE5 projects, enabling browser-based selection and **Auto-Registration**. **Context-Aware Queries** enhance AI responses using active project data. **Editor Orchestration Systems** (SceneOrchestrator, ViewportController, ActorManipulator) facilitate scene building, camera control, and actor manipulation.

A **Fully Automated Widget Generator** within the Tools tab provides AI-powered Editor Utility Widget generation. Users input widget details, and OpenAI generates a complete UE 5.6 Python script, which the backend queues for the UE5 client to write locally. A **File Drop Tool** allows developers to test end-to-end file writing capabilities. **Persistent Operation & Event History** is maintained via bounded FIFO lists (max 100 entries) for operations and system events, displayed in the Live Feed. A **Server Switching System** allows granular control over backend endpoints for connected clients.

**Real-Time Communication** uses a dual-mode system with WebSockets (preferred) and HTTP Polling fallback. A local **Deploy Agent** (localhost:7865) ensures frictionless deployment and auto-import into UE5. The system supports **Blueprint Screenshot Capture** for multi-modal vision analysis. An **Enhanced Action Executor** handles file operations, project info display, and blueprint management, controlled by a **Feature Flag System**. A **UE5 Mock Testing Environment** allows Replit-based testing without an active UE5 instance. The **Flexible Token Extraction System** uses regex patterns to extract action tokens from AI responses, allowing natural language alongside commands. **Production Server Auto-Selection** ensures the UE5 client connects to the production backend by default.

The system includes **Multi-Server Detection and Display** that automatically identifies and shows which server (localhost, production, or custom) each UE5 client is connected to. The backend captures the server URL from HTTP request headers during registration and polling, categorizes it as localhost (127.0.0.1/localhost), production (replit.app/repl.co), or custom (any other URL), and broadcasts this information to all connected dashboards via WebSocket. The dashboard displays server information in the Live Feed's Client Status sub-tab with color-coded indicators: orange for localhost (üè† Localhost - Dev), green for production (üåê Production - Replit), and purple for custom servers (‚öôÔ∏è Custom Server). This gives full transparency to multi-server setups and ensures developers always know which backend their UE5 clients are communicating with.

The system incorporates a **Universal Bootstrap System** for seamless client updates, handling both ZIP and TAR.GZ formats. It also includes an **Emergency Fix Update System** with a GUI-based solution for non-technical users to resolve thread safety crashes without manual restarts. **Connection Troubleshooting Tools** are built-in, providing console-based utilities (e.g., reconnect, test server) for easy recovery. A **Dashboard Reconnect Button** offers a GUI-based recovery path for dropped connections. A **UE5 Editor Toolbar Menu** provides easy access to troubleshooting tools directly from the editor without console interaction.

### System Design Choices
The system uses a **RESTful API** with JSON payloads and enforces **Separation of Concerns** between UE viewport data collection and AI processing. **Environment-based Configuration** manages sensitive data. It includes robust **Error Handling** with structured logging and retry logic. A **Thread-Safe Action Queue** integrates with the Unreal Slate ticker for safe main thread execution. **Automatic Cache Management** is implemented via module version tracking. **Security Hardening** ensures path traversal protection and read-only file operations. All UE5 client code adheres to **UE5.6 API Compliance**.

## Connection Recovery & Troubleshooting

### UE5 Editor Toolbar Menu
The system includes a **UE5 Editor Toolbar dropdown menu** that provides easy access to troubleshooting tools directly from the editor without requiring console interaction:
- **Location**: "AI Assistant" dropdown in the UE5 main menu bar (automatically added on startup)
- **Menu Items**:
  - **üîß Launch Troubleshooter**: Imports troubleshooter module and displays available commands in Output Log
  - **üîÑ Restart Assistant**: Restarts the AI Assistant connection with fresh code (fixes most connection issues)
- **Auto-Registration**: Toolbar menu is registered automatically when the assistant initializes and persists across restarts
- **User Experience**: Non-technical users can access troubleshooting tools via familiar UI menus instead of Python console commands
- **Implementation**: Uses UE5's ToolMenus API to register menu entries with Python command execution

This toolbar dropdown eliminates the need for users to remember console commands or feel intimidated by Python scripting, providing a friendly GUI-based recovery path for connection issues.

### Console-Based Troubleshooting Tools
The system includes **built-in console-based troubleshooting tools** (`troubleshooter.py`) for advanced users:
- **Simple Import**: `import AIAssistant.troubleshooter as ts` provides instant access to all tools
- **Quick Reconnect**: `ts.reconnect()` restarts HTTP polling when connection drops
- **Server Testing**: `ts.test_server()` verifies backend connectivity with detailed diagnostics
- **Status Check**: `ts.status()` shows current connection state
- **Connection Info**: `ts.info()` displays complete connection details (URL, project ID, poll settings)
- **Dashboard Launcher**: `ts.dashboard()` opens web dashboard in browser
- **Help System**: `ts.help()` shows all available commands and usage examples

### Dashboard Force Re-register Button
The dashboard includes a **GUI-based re-registration system** for clients that are still polling but need to refresh their backend registration:
- **Auto-Detection**: Project cards automatically display a "Force Re-register" button when clients become inactive or disconnected
- **Tooltip Guidance**: Button includes tooltip explaining it works only if client is still polling, directs users to toolbar menu for hard disconnects
- **Thread-Safe Implementation**: Uses flag-based system that performs simple re-registration via POST on existing polling thread
- **Limitations**: Only works when client is actively polling; for hard disconnects, users must use UE5 toolbar menu or console tools
- **Backend Endpoint**: `/api/reconnect_client` queues a "reconnect" command for the specified UE5 client
