## Test It Works

Try these questions:
- "What is my project name?"
- "Tell me about this project"
- "Show me project files"

**Expected:** Natural conversational answers (not data dumps)

---

## What Context-Aware Means

The AI now:
- ✅ Collects real UE5 project data
- ✅ Interprets it intelligently
- ✅ Answers your specific question
- ✅ Speaks naturally (no more data dumps)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Still getting data dumps?**
→ Delete `__pycache__` and restart UE5

**No response?**
→ Check backend: https://ue5-assistant-noahbutcher97.replit.app

**Error messages?**
→ Check UE5 Output Log for details

---

## Files Changed

**UE5 Client (you deploy):**
- `main.py` - Added context-aware response handling

**Backend (already live):**
- `app/routes.py` - New `/answer_with_context` endpoint

---

**Status:** ✅ Ready to Deploy
**Time to Deploy:** ~2 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy (copy files, restart editor)
