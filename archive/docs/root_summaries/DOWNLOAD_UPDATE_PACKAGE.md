## 📋 Installation Steps (After Download)

### Step 1: Close UE5
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Close Unreal Editor completely!

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
Go to: `D:\UnrealProjects\5.6\UE5_Assistant\Content\Python\AIAssistant\`

### Step 3: Backup (Optional)
Rename your current files:
- `main.py` → `main.py.backup`
- `http_polling_client.py` → `http_polling_client.py.backup`
- `auto_update.py` → `auto_update.py.backup`

### Step 4: Copy New Files
Copy the 3 downloaded files to replace the old ones:
- ✅ `main.py`

- ✅ `auto_update.py`

### Step 5: Restart UE5
Launch your project normally.

### Step 6: Verify
Look for these **NEW** log messages in Output Log:
```
[HTTP] About to check result and return...
[HTTP] self.http_client = <HTTPPollingClient object at 0x...>
✅ Real-time connection enabled (HTTP Polling)
```

If you see these, the fix is installed! 🎉

### Step 7: Confirm Connection
In Python Console:
```python
import AIAssistant.main
assistant = AIAssistant.main.get_assistant()
print(f"HTTP Client: {assistant.http_client}")
print(f"Connected: {assistant.http_client.connected}")
```

**Expected:**
```
HTTP Client: <HTTPPollingClient object at 0x...>
Connected: True
```
