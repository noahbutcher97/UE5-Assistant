# Quick Reload Fix (Without Restarting UE5)

## The Problem
`importlib.reload(AIAssistant.main)` only reloads the main module, but the ActionExecutor instance with the old action registry is still in memory.

## Solution: Deep Reload

Run this in your UE5 Python console:

```python
import sys
# Remove all AIAssistant modules from cache
modules_to_remove = [key for key in sys.modules.keys() if key.startswith('AIAssistant')]
for module in modules_to_remove:
    del sys.modules[module]

# Now import fresh
import AIAssistant
```

This forces Python to reload ALL AIAssistant modules from disk, including action_executor.py with the new get_project_info action.

## Test After Reload

Try: `"give me a breakdown of my project"`

You should see:
```
[ActionExecutor] ℹ️ Executing: get_project_info
[ActionExecutor] ✅ Action completed: get_project_info
```

## Important Note

This is a **temporary workaround**. The proper fix is still to:
1. Download fresh code from Replit
2. Delete __pycache__ folders
3. Restart UE5

The modules you currently have loaded are from the old files on disk. If you haven't downloaded the updated code yet, this reload won't help because it will just reload the old files again.
